   Ensure the MQTT integration in Home Assistant is properly connected to your broker.  
2. **[iR2mqtt](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt)** and iRacing running to read iRacing telemetry.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After installation and restarting Home Assistant, setup is done through the UI:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services**.  
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **iR2mqtt**.  
   Alternatively, you can click this button to start directly:  
   [![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=ir2mqtt)
3. Enter the **MQTT Topic Prefix** (if you changed the default):
   * Default value: `iracing`.
4. Click **Submit**.

A new device called **iRacing Telemetry** will be created immediately.  
Entities will initially appear as ‚ÄúUnavailable‚Äù. They will automatically update and become active once iR2mqtt app starts publishing telemetry data.

Here is an [automation](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt/blob/main/Guides/yaml/automation-example.yaml) example that controls light entity according to iracing flags.
