![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jmlt/ir2mqtt_integration)

Home Assistant integration for [iR2mqtt](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt). Automatically creates iRacing telemetry sensors from MQTT data.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automatic Discovery:** Automatically creates and configures sensors and binary sensors related to iRacing telemetry.  
* **Unified Device:** All entities are grouped under a single ‚ÄúiRacing Telemetry‚Äù device for a clean, organized structure inside Home Assistant.  
* **Included Sensors:**
  * **Sensors:** Speed (m/s, km/h, mph), RPM, Gear, Fuel Level, Current Lap, Session Time, Session Type, Incidents, Start Lights, and more.
  * **Binary Sensors:** On Pit Road, Active Flags (Green, Yellow, White, Blue, etc.), Start Lights (Ready, Set, Go).

## üß© Requirements

To use this integration, you must have:

1. A configured **MQTT Broker**. The official [Mosquitto broker](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mosquitto) add-on is recommended.  
   Ensure the MQTT integration in Home Assistant is properly connected to your broker.  
2. **[iR2mqtt](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt)** and iRacing running to read iRacing telemetry.  

---

## üì¶ Installation (via HACS)
 
1. **Add this repository as a Custom Repository**
   - Go to **HACS ‚Üí Integrations**.
   - Click the three-dot menu (top right) ‚Üí **Custom repositories**.
   - **Repository URL:** Paste the URL of this GitHub repository <pre>https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt_integration/</pre>
   - **Category:** Select `Integration`.
   - Click **Add**.
2. Restart Home Assistant. 
3. Proceed to Configuration

<details>
<summary>Without HACS</summary>

1. Download the latest release of the iR2mqtt integration from [GitHub Releases)](https://github.com/jmlt/ir2mqtt_integration/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded files and place the ir2mqtt folder in your Home Assistant custom_components directory (usually located in the config/custom_components directory).
3. Restart your Home Assistant instance to load the new integration.
</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After installation and restarting Home Assistant, setup is done through the UI:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services**.  
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **iR2mqtt**.  
   Alternatively, you can click this button to start directly:  
   [![Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=ir2mqtt)
3. Enter the **MQTT Topic Prefix** (if you changed the default):
   * Default value: `iracing`.
4. Click **Submit**.

A new device called **iRacing Telemetry** will be created immediately.  
Entities will initially appear as ‚ÄúUnavailable‚Äù. They will automatically update and become active once iR2mqtt app starts publishing telemetry data.
